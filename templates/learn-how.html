                    <p class="text-center">To create an account, navigate to the "Sign Up" link on the navigation bar. 
                        Fill out all fields and click the blue "Sign Up" button to finalize your account.
                        Make sure your password is something you can remember!</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h4>Logging In</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">Once your account is created, go ahead and log in. Navigate to the "Login" link on the navigation bar
                        and enter the email and password you used at signup into the form's fields. Press the "Login" button to enter your account.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h4>Browsing Books</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Next, what you came here for! Click on the "Browse Books" link in the navigation bar. You'll be redirected to a page where you can view
                        all of our latest offerings. From here, you can add a book to your wishlist, request a book, or search for a specific book. Keep in mind you
                        can only request books for which you have enough points. More on that later.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Searching for a Book</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Is there a specific book you're looking for? Scroll down to the bottom of the "Browse Books" page to search for a specific book. You can search by
                        author, title, or ISBN, but keep in mind the most efficient search is to look up the book by its ISBN. Once you initiate a search, you'll be redirected
                        to a page with all the appropriate results, and you'll be able to add the results to your wishlist or request them directly.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Requesting a Book</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Decided on the book you want? Click the "Request Trade" button to request to trade the posted book with the named user. You'll need a certain amount of points
                        to make this request, and those points will be given to the user who listed the book upon acceptance of the trade. Once you've clicked the button, a panel will
                        open with the final trade information. You can either close this trade by clicking "cancel" or officially request the book by clicking the 
                        "Please Request This Book" button.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Wishing for a Book</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Have a book on your mind, but don't want to request the current options yet? Click the "Add to Wishlist" button to add the book to your wishlist. You'll be able
                        to keep your wishlist forever, so you can keep track of which books you want and haven't been able to trade yet.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Adding Books to Sell</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Ready to trade some books? Head over to the "My Books" link on the navigation bar. You can search our database for a book that you have, and add it
                        to your listings so you can trade your copy. Underneath "Books You Have Listed" you'll be able to see all the books you've listed to trade. You can 
                        remove any books from this list you no longer want to trade with the "Remove" button, or change how many points you'd like for it with the "Change" button
                        underneath the "Points" column. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Managing Trades</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        If you head to the "My Trades" link on the navigation bar, you'll see all trade requests made for the books you've posted. You can accept or reject the trade
                        with the corresponding buttons. If you reject the trade, your book is simply returned to our library for another user to request at a later time. If you accept
                        the trade, you'll be given the appropriate amount of points and prompted to ship off your book. Don't forget to send your buyer their book as you'll be 
                        penalized for any unfulfilled requests. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Point System</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        All trading on the website is managed by a generic point system. Every time a book is listed for trade, it is given a point value by the listing user. To
                        trade the book with this user, you'll need that many points. Requesting the book will remove that many points from your total, and they will be returned to you
                        should the trade be denied. If the trade is accepted, those points are sent to the listing user, and you'll be sent your book. 
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        As a listing user, you'll set the point price of any book you list, and will receive the points for any trade requests you accept. 
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Wondering how to get your first points? To encourage active swapping, you won't get any points until you start listing books. After you've
                        listed enough books, you'll be automatically rewarded with some points to get you started. 
                    </p>
